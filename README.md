# RimworldMortarAccuracy

Steamworks version of mod found here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1729446857

### Installation
Copy the entire MortarAccuracy folder into your Rimworld/Mods directory. Ex:
C:\Program Files (x86)\RimWorld\Mods\

Launch Rimworld, enable Mortar Accuracy in mod menu. Can access more settings in Options/Mod Settings/Mortar Accuracy from main menu in-game.

### Description
A collection of options to make mortars more/less accurate. Customizable in the Mod Settings menu. These changes affect all mortar shots, including enemy mortars. Changes include:
* **Lead moving targets!**
* **Weather:** Mortar accuracy is affected by weather and time of day (in vanilla, mortar shots rarely are affected by weather)
* **Colonist Skill:** Mortar accuracy is affected by colonist Intellectual and/or Shooting skill (in vanilla, skill makes no difference)
* **Cover Miss Chance Removed:** Mortars no longer have a chance to miss due to cover surrounding the target (in vanilla, target's cover causes missed shots)
* **Accuracy preview** shows the accuracy radius with the current colonist/weather conditions and settings (in Mod Settings can revert to showing blast radius instead)
* **Can customize** how much high-skill colonists can improve mortar accuracy, and how much low-skill colonists hurt accuracy
By default, a colonist with maximum skill will improve a mortar's accuracy to 75%. A colonist with no skill will affect a mortar's accuracy by -40% of it's normal value. These values can be changed in Mod Settings (can set all skill-levels to have 100% perfect accuracy if desired)

### Saved Games and Compatibility
Can be freely added/removed from saved games.
[WD] Expanded Artillery: Accuracy affects new mortars and cannons
More Vanilla Turrets 1.0: Accuracy affects manned rocket turret, manned blast charge turret, and devastator mortar

### Known Issues
Combat Extended: Incompatible! Patch is unlikely with CE being such a large overhaul. CE does have their own mortar accuracy mechanics though with spotting binoculars
[XND] TE Turret Expansion: This mod also affects mortar accuracy so it is likely that whatever mod is higher in your load order will be overwritten. Patch is likely.

### Multiplayer
99% sure this works in multiplayer, but I have yet to test it.
