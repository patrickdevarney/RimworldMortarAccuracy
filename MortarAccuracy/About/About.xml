<description>A collection of changes and options to make mortar accuracy better/worse, instead of having a fixed spread radius of 13 tiles.

-Accuracy is affected by a colonist's Intellectual and/or Shooting skills
-Automatically lead moving targets
-Accuracy is affected by weather and time of day
-When targeting, preview a projectile's hit radius or show explosive radius
-The miss chance caused by targets being in cover is removed

This affects all mortar shots, including enemy mortars.

Supports other mods:
In general, any added mortars are supported (artillery, catapults, ballistas, etc.). Technically anything using the verb Verb_Shoot and has a force miss radius is assumed to be a mortar and is affected by this mod.

Load order does not matter in order to affect modded mortars.
